I found overhead by calculating the difference in time between executing clock_gettime twice consecutively before executing the scenario's function.
This resulted in an overhead value of around 0.0000004 seconds. 

To find the averages of all the times, for loops to 1000 were used to repeatedly execute the commands and the difference between start and end times
were stored and had the overhead substracted from this value. Then, this time was added to a variable totaltime across every for loop iteration
before the end where this value was divided by 1000 and printed out. Because scenario 5 required manual execution, its average time was calculated 
after only 10 time captures.
